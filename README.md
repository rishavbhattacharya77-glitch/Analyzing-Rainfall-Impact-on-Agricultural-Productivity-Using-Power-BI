Analyzing Rainfall Impact on Agricultural Productivity Using Power BI

Background and Context:
Agriculture significantly depends on climatic conditions, particularly rainfall patterns. 
Variability in rainfall can drastically impact crop yield, profitability, and agricultural 
sustainability. Analyzing historical rainfall data and understanding its correlation with 
agricultural productivity can empower stakeholders to make informed, strategic decisions 
aimed at maximizing yields and managing climate-related risks effectively.

Project Objective:
This project aims to empower learners to perform comprehensive data analytics and build an 
interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and interprets the relationship between 
rainfall patterns and agricultural productivity.
